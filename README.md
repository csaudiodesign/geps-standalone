# GePS 2.0

GePS reinvented. An evolved, integrated and standalone electronic musical instrument based on the research done on [GePS 1.0](https://github.com/csaudiodesign/GePS).

This repository accompanies the developments that we document at our [Hackaday Project](https://hackaday.io/project/160886-geps).

## Goals

- Better form factor for easier wearability
- Lower latency for better performance experience through improved fusion of movement and sound
- Standalone sound module to be able to play the instrument without a laptop or workstation connected.

Furthermore we aim for better hackability through more programming interfaces and updated documentation as well as new and exciting sound modules and content.
