# GePS 2.0 - Gesture-based Performance System

_standalone gesture controlled musical instrument_

GePS reinvented. An evolved, integrated and standalone electronic musical instrument based on the research done on [GePS 1.0](https://github.com/csaudiodesign/GePS).

- Better form factor for easier wearability
- Lower latency for better performance experience through improved fusion of movement and sound
- Standalone sound module to be able to play the instrument without a laptop or workstation connected.

Furthermore we aim for better hackability through more programming interfaces ([sound module documentation](http://geps.synack.ch/doc-software.html)) and updated documentation as well as new and exciting sound modules ([geps-externals](https://github.com/csaudiodesign/geps-externals)!) and content.

This repository accompanies the developments that we document at our [Hackaday Project](https://hackaday.io/project/160886-geps).
